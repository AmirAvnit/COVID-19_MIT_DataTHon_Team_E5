<b> Project objective: </b> Finding sociodemographic and clinical risk factors related to COVID-19 mortality in the United States.

Team was on Track E - Epidemiology of COVID-19: 
The COVID-19 Pandemic is the greatest global public health crisis during the past century adversely impacting millions of peopleâ€™s health and economies. The world must come together to address this global challenge and develop healthcare, scientific, technical, social, and economic solutions. In order to do this effectively, it is important to understand the scale of the problem, sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of people affected, as well as risk factors for infection, mortality and other adverse health outcomes. This track focuses on generating insights from public data sources to address these issues in order to guide decision-making and the development of effective solutions.
